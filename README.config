This documents the config file -- irc-subst.cfg -- that is required to be present when
loading the irc-subst.py script.

Because the module used to read the config file is configparser, the config file format
is reminicent of windows .ini files.

Currently, there are two sections, they are called 'general' and 'db', of those two, only
the 'db' section is required.

Currently, there are two options in the 'general' section: one is called command-prefix,
and the value of this option, is the single-character prefix expected on irc lines that
are commands.

For example, there is a command lskeys which will list all the keys in the db to the irc
client; in order to run that command, you would type the prefix character from the
config file, then "lskeys". If the command-prefix were . (which it is by default), the
command would look like: .lskeys

The other option in the general section is called print-config, and if true, it means
the config file will be printed to the current context (or tab) of the hexchat irc
client each time the config file is reloaded.

The db section works a little differently: you put all the options needed to connect to the
database.

If you want the name of your app to appear in postgresql logs, then you would include
an attribute called 'appname' in the db section; see the examples below.

application_name is described here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15685861/setting-application-name-on-postgres-sqlalchemy

Here are some examples:

[general]
command-prefix = !
print-config = true
[db]
dbname = ircsubst
user = george
password = secret
host = myserver.windwalker.co.uk
appname = irc_subst

If the database server is running on the same machine as the irc client and script, you don't 
need to include a host, and maybe also not a password.

Another example, with the server being the same machine:

[general]
command-prefix = .
print-config = true
[db]
dbname = mydb
user = john
appname = irc_subst
